**What do you consider Data Science to be?**

I consider data science to be taking data and using it in such a way that it solves some sort of problem or answers a question. Data science gives meaning to numbers and creates a better understanding of the data, this is often communicated through visualizations of findings. An example of data science I think is really cool is the feature in the **Google Arts & Culture app** that matches users selfies to famous artistic portraits.

Using facial structure data from thousands of photos and portraits, the app is able to match similar features and give users a "match" percentage for various pieces of art that look like them.
